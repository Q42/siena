<h2>Welcome to siena project!</h2>

<p>Siena is a persitence API for Java inspired by the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/fr/appengine/docs/python/datastore/">Google App Engine Python Datastore</a> trying to <b>draw a bridge between SQL and NoSQL</b> worlds.</p>

<p/>
<h3>News</h3>
<ul class="focus">
	<li>Current stable version is <a href="https://github.com/mandubian/siena/tree/1.0.0-b5">Siena 1.0.0-b5</a></li>
	<li>New extensions for great Java lightweight &amp; scalable web framework <a href="http://www.playframework.org/modules/siena">Play!</a> making Siena a very practical alternative to JPA in this great development environment</li>
	<li>Moved code to <a href="https://github.com/mandubian/siena">Github</a></li>
	<li>Original code has been refactored, enhanced those last months and lots of new features have appeared (<i>batch, pagination, statefulness, aggregation, owned relations</i>)</li>
	<li>New lead developer is <a href="mailto:pascal.voitot.dev@gmail.com">Pascal Voitot</a> (Thanks to Alberto Gimeno, creator and initiator of the project for his great work and to all Siena supporters)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example usage</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// creates one employee
Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.firstName = "John";
emp.lastName = "Doe";
emp.insert();
// updates it
emp.age = 23;
emp.update();

//retrieves the same employee
Employee sameEmp = Model.getByKey(Employee.class, emp.id);

// gets some employees with filtering/ordering
List&lt;Employee&gt; someEmployees = Employee.all()
		.filter("firstName", "Mark")
		.order("-lastName")
		.fetch(10);		

// inserts a few employees created before
Employee.batch().insert(emp1, emp2, emp3, emp4);
</pre>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Siena provides a Java Object-DB mapping & querying API</b>
<p>It is designed following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern#Java">ActiveRecord pattern</a> which brings a simple and intuitive approach to manage your Java objects with respect to the database entities.</p></li> 
<li><b>Siena tries to provide a common API for SQL/NoSQL</b>
<p>Yet, Siena but doesn't pretend to be a kind of hibernate for SQL+NoSQL which would be crazy. It just intends to make the transition easier when changing database from SQL to NoSQL and vis versa by being able to reuse (almost) the same code without modifying too much.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Siena is a single API with many implementations</b>
<p class="list">You can already use siena with:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/documentation-gae.html">Google App Engine's datastore</a></li> 
	<li><a href="/documentation-jdbc.html">SQL Relational Databases (MySQL, H2, PostGres)</a></li>
	<li><i>Other implementations are under development (Redis just now and soon SDB, HBase, Mongo)</i></li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Siena is Open Source</b> and is released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a></li>
<p/>
<li><b>Siena doesnâ€™t try to hide all the specific database technical aspects</b>
<p>Siena tries to provide a thin layer, very near from the low-level datastore but if you need to low-level datastore, you can use it directly.</p>
</li>  
<li><b>Siena development is a user experience driven process</b> 
<p>We going from the user needs to the technical aspects of SQL/NoSQL databases and not the other way.</p>
</li>  
</ul>

<br/>
<h3>Main features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-aware models based on Active Record pattern</li>
<li>Simple Querying syntax with ordering/filtering/iterating</li>
<li>Stateless & threadsafe (but can become stateful when required)</li>
<li>one request = one transaction by default (but can trigger manual control of transactions)</li>
<li>Easy representation of different kinds of entity relations</li>
<li>Very simple entities pagination mechanism (can use GAE cursors for forward & also backward paging)</li>
<li>One single JAR, no external dependencies</li>
<li>Full control of your entities, no hidden cache, no persistence context...  
<li>Can work with everything in Java world from the heaviest JEE servers to the lightest pure Java application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple join operations (native for SQL and simulated for GAE)</li>
<li>Batch operations to manipulate multiple entities</li>
<li>Asynchronous datastore (only for GAE for the time being)</li>
<li>Entity Embedding (store complex structure serialized in JSON for SQL/GAE & Java-object + native embedding only for GAE)</li>
<li>Entity aggregation (only for GAE for the time being based on entity grouping)</li>
</ul>

<li>the <a href="/documentation-getting-started.html">The old (and a bit outdated) <i>Getting Started</i> guide</a> which will give a bit more info of a few things you can do in Siena.</li>
